TRENDEMIC

Python implementation of the Trendemic agent-based computational model.

Requirements:
Python 3

Optional Dependencies:
Matplotlib
TkInter

Usage:
python trendemic.py

Makefile Options:
make clean
    Clean up working files and logs created by the software.
    Note: This will remove any JSON files created by the other make options.

make data
    Run a number of random seeds comparing selected decision models.
    Note: Results will be saved in the data subdirectory.

make plots
    Generate graph plots from any JSON files in the data subdirectory.
    Note: Plots are dependent on a dataset existing and will create it if necessary.

make run
    Run the simulation using the default config.json file and storing a local log in the log.json file.

make setup
    Change preconfigured settings for the system Python alias.
    Note: Changed settings may alter Makefile and configuration file in-place.


JSON Configuration File Options:
The simulation provides a default set of options in a dictionary in the trendemic.py file.
A JSON configuration file can be passed to the simulation, overwriting the default configuration, with the --conf option.

debugMode: [string, ...]
    Set the debug printing mode.
    Options: "agent", "all", "behavior", "none",  "trendemic"
    Default: "none"
    Note: Some options may cause no output in current impementation.
    Note: Can select multiple debug modes simultaneously.

experimentalGroup: string
    Set the experimental group of agents under study for finer-grained logging.
    Options: "influencers"
    Default: null

headlessMode: bool
    Set whether the GUI is enabled.
    Default: false

interfaceHeight: int
    Set number of pixels for GUI height.
    Default: 1000
    Note: Values below zero will cause the interface to fit to 1/2 total display height.

interfaceWidth: int
    Set number of pixels for GUI width.
    Default: 900
    Note: Values below zero will cause the interface to fit to 1/2 total display width.

logfile: path
    Set the path of the log file.
    Default: null

logfileFormat: string
    Set the file format for the log file.
    Default: "json"

numAgents: int
    Set the number of agents placed in the initial population.
    Default: 10

profileMode: bool
    Set whether performance profiling mode is enabled.
    Default: false

seed: int
    Set the seed value for the random number generator.
    Default: -1
    Note: Value of -1 causes simulation to generate a random seed.
    Note: Reusing a seed ensures deterministic simulation outcomes.

timesteps: int
    Set the number of timesteps the simulation runs.
    Default: 200
    Note: Value of -1 causes simulation to run forever or until there are no more living agents.

Other JSON Configurable Options:
numParallelSimJobs: int
    Set the number of simulations to run in parallel during data collection.
    Default: 1

numSeeds: int
    Set the number of random seeds to be tested in data collection.
    Default: 100

plots: [string, ...]
    Set the plots to be created once data has been collected.
    Options:
    Default: []

plotIncrement: float
    Set the value by which the generated plots index across the sweep parameter values.
    Default: 0.1

plotStatistic: string
    Set the statistic to use for plotting.
    Options: "mean", "median"
    Default: "mean"

plotTimesteps: int
    Set the number of timesteps to plot in graphs as the X axis.
    Default: 1000
    Note: This option does not control how many timesteps the simulation runs.

pythonAlias: string
    Set the alias to the local Python 3 installation.
    Default: "python"
    Note: Python 3 is required to run the simulation.

sweepIncrement: float
    Set the value by which the sweep parameter is incremented.
    Default: 0.01
    Note: If not provided, the decimals provided in the sweep parameter range are used to calculate the increment.

sweepParamenter: string
    Set the parameter for performing a parameter sweep during data collection.
    Options: "agentThreshold", "agentScaleFreeSmallWorldRatio", "numAgents", "numInfluencers", "scaleFreeHubs", "scaleFreeStartingEdgesPerAgent", "smallWorldEdgesPerAgent", "smallWorldRewiringProbability"
    Default: "agentThreshold"

sweepRange: [float, float]
    Set the minimum and maximum values for the parameter sweep.
    Default: [0.2, 0.7]

thresholdSearchDirection: string
    Set the direction to search for the first or last instance of a sweep parameter value which meets or exceeds the adoption threshold.
    Options: "highest", "lowest"
    Default: "highest"
